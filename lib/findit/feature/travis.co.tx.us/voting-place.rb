      # This class manages the voting place dataset, created by
      # a "generate" script. It is used to load the dataset, and
      # then generate the classes that access the data.
      #
      # The dataset is located in the file:
      #
      #   <LIBDIR>/findit/feature/travis.co.tx.us/data/voting-places/Voting_Places_<ELECTION>.dat
      #
      # where <ELECTION> is an identifier for the election, typically
      # in "YYYYMMDD" form.
      #
      # The dataset is stored as a Marshal hash with four items:
      #
      # * :locations -- A table (Hash) of physical location (address,
      #   latitude/longitued, etc.) for each of the voting places, indexed by id.
      # * :places_eday -- A table (Hash) of voting places on election day,
      #   indexed by precinct number.
      # * :places_evfixed -- A list (Array) of "fixed" early voting locations,
      #   that are available during the early voting period.
      # * :places_evmobile -- A list (Array) of "mobile" early voting locations,
      #   that are available only on specified dates during the early voting period.
