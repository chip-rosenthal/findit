Notes on Voting Place Generation

Voting_Places_20120512.csv

    May 29, 2012 -- Voting_Places_20120731.csv

    The "20120512-GA12-May_12_EDay_Polling_Places_Guide_Final.xls",
    file is the source to a PDF "voting place" document published by
    Travis County. I extracted the locations and did a batch geolocation
    to obtain the resulting dataset. The quality is poor: there are
    locations with missing lat/lng information and locations with wrong
    lat/lng inforation.

Voting_Places_20120731.csv

    Jul 31, 2012 -- Joint Primary Runoff

    This dataset was generated by scraping www.traviscountytax.org with
    20120731-tcvp-scraper.rb

Voting_Places_20121106.csv

    Nov 6, 2012 -- General Election (Presidential)

    Got a *GREAT* dataset ("20121106-chipG12_WEBLoad_FINAL.xlsx")
    from Travis County Elections Division.

    First, I manually burst the spreadsheet into individual CSV files
    ("20121106-chipG12_WEBLoad_FINAL_XXXXXX.csv"), one file per sheet.

    Then the "20121106-generate.rb" script is run to process these
    files into "Voting_Places_20121106.dat", using a new format
    that is imported by FindIt::Feature::Travis_CO_TX_US::VotingPlaceData.
