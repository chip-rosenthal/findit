  <h1>Find It Nearby</h1>

  <p>The "Find It Nearby" application will identify features in
    Austin, TX that are closest to you. The features it knows about are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Police stations</li>
    <li>Fire stations</li>
    <li>Post offices</li>
    <li>Libraries</li>
    <li>Moon towers (<a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_tower#Moonlight_towers_in_Austin.2C_Texas">huh?</a>)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you first start the application it will try to determine
    where you are. Depending on your web browser settings, you may be
    prompted to allow your location to be identified. Once you have been
    located, it will draw a map showing your position and the nearby
    features.</p>

  <p>Here are some things you can do with the map:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click a location on the map to see what features are nearby.</li>
    <li>Drag the red "you are here" marker around, to explore a different area.</li>
    <li>Type an address in the field at the bottom of the screen to map that location.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Voting Places</h2>

  <p>The "Vote" icons identify voting places for the selected "you are here" location.</p>  
  
  <table class="icon-key">
    <tr>
      <td class="icon"><img src="mapicons/vote_icon.png" style="width: 32px; height: 32px"/></td>
      <td>
        <p>The election day voting place for the "you are here" location.</p>
        <p>This is the place you go to vote on election day.</p>
        <p>Note that for some elections, the State of Texas allows "Election Day Vote Centers".
          For these elections, you can vote at any polling place, not just the one in your
          assigned neighborhood precinct.</p>
        <p>Election day vote centers will be in effect for the November 6, 2012
          general election.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="icon"><img src="mapicons/vote_early_icon.png" style="width: 32px; height: 32px"/></td>
      <td>
        <p>The early voting place that is closest to the "you are here" location.</p>
        <p>If you are registered to vote in Travis County, then you can vote at any of the
         early voting places during the early voting period.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="icon"><img src="mapicons/vote_mobile_icon.png" style="width: 32px; height: 32px"/></td>
      <td>
        <p>A <em>mobile</em> early voting place that is convenient to the "you are here" location.</p>
        <p>The mobile early voting places are open only at certain times during the early voting
          period. If you are registered to vote in Travis County, then you can vote at any mobile
          early voting place that is open.</p>
        <p>The map will display <em>only</em> mobile early voting places that are convenient to
          your "you are here" location. You won't see any mobile places if you are in a location
          where the fixed early voting place is the best choice.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>This feature is possible thanks to the open data published by Travis
    County Clerk (voting places) and Travis County Tax-Assessor Collector
    (voting district).</p>

  <h2>Powered by Open Source and Open Government</h2>

  <p>In January 2012, the City of Austin released the <a
    href="http://data.austintexas.gov/">data.austintexas.gov</a> open
    government data portal. This application is built on publicly
    available data provided there. At this time, only a limited number
    of data collections are available, so only a small set of features
    are supported here.</p>

  <p>What else would you like to see? How about driver license offices?
    Bike racks? Public wi-fi access points? If the City releases that
    information, I'll add it to the application.</p>

  <p>This application is written by Chip Rosenthal, with support from the
    "Find It" team from the "Code for America Hack-a-Thon", February
    2012. The source is available at: <a
